<p>And as soon as we&#8217;ve completed the project, well, we&#8217;re back at square one, right? Hunting for work, trying to make a decent wage and finding clients that respect us.</p>
<p>Booo. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a secret though - it doesn&#8217;t matter how talented we are. We can design the sharpest pixels, write the DRYest code, or even craft the best copy. </p>
<p>At the end of the day we&#8217;re all subject to dry spells. We get caught up in a horrible feast and famine cycle. Too much work, or not enough work – it&#8217;s never just right. </p>
<p>If we&#8217;ve been in the freelance game for even just a few months we&#8217;re also likely experiencing some of these &#8216;side effects&#8217; too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can&#8217;t find clients that respect our expertise and give us the creative control we want.</li>
<li>Charging more than a few thousand per project seems impossible.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re spending a ton of unbillabe time on bids, RFPs and estimates. Bleh!</li>
<li>And of course, we compete on price with cheap outsourcers in a race to the bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there hope? Should we just quit freelancing altogether and get a desk job?</p>
<h2>I’ve been there before and experienced all of these problems (and more) firsthand. I want to help.</h2>
<p>In 1999, at the age of 14, I sold my first website project. A swanky Flash site for a local locksmith. You remember Flash right? </p>
<p>I charged a flat fee of $2,000.</p>
<p>On that very day the check came it was as if the heavens had opened up and cash began to rain. I thought I had figured it all out (ActionScript included).</p>
<p>Can you guess what the next day brought?</p>
<p>Zero new clients. No referrals. Drought.</p>
<p>It would take me another decade of on and off freelancing for things to finally click. Ten years before I realized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality clients are a function of how much you charge.</li>
<li>That client &#8216;budgets&#8217; are never set in stone.*   Charging $10,000 for a &#8220;simple&#8221; website was doable AND repeatable.</li>
<li>That working sane hours (and enjoying weekends) was totally possible.</li>
<li>And that relying on referrals alone for new clients <strong><em>guaranteed</em></strong> a nasty feast and famine cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will you let me help you avoid these pitfalls and more? </p>
<p>Yes?</p>
