## Consistently finding new freelance gigs is a struggles – _and that's just for mediocre clients with meh budgets._

And as soon as we've completed the project, well, we're back at square one, right? Hunting for work, trying to make a decent wage and finding clients that respect us.

Booo. 

Here's a secret though - it doesn't matter how talented we are. We can design the sharpest pixels, write the DRYest code, or even craft the best copy. 

At the end of the day we're all subject to dry spells. We get caught up in a horrible feast and famine cycle. Too much work, or not enough work – it's never just right. 

If we've been in the freelance game for even just a few months we're also likely experiencing some of these 'side effects' too:

*   Can't find clients that respect our expertise and give us the creative control we want.
*   Charging more than a few thousand per project seems impossible.
*   We're spending a ton of unbillabe time on bids, RFPs and estimates. Bleh!
*   And of course, we compete on price with cheap outsourcers in a race to the bottom.

Is there hope? Should we just quit freelancing altogether and get a desk job?

## I’ve been there before and experienced all of these problems (and more) firsthand. I want to help.

In 1999, at the age of 14, I sold my first website project. A swanky Flash site for a local locksmith. You remember Flash right? 

I charged a flat fee of $2,000.

On that very day the check came it was as if the heavens had opened up and cash began to rain. I thought I had figured it all out (ActionScript included).

Can you guess what the next day brought?

Zero new clients. No referrals. Drought.

It would take me another decade of on and off freelancing for things to finally click. Ten years before I realized:

*   Quality clients are a function of how much you charge.
*   That client 'budgets' are never set in stone.*   Charging $10,000 for a "simple" website was doable AND repeatable.
*   That working sane hours (and enjoying weekends) was totally possible.
*   And that relying on referrals alone for new clients **_guaranteed_** a nasty feast and famine cycle.

Will you let me help you avoid these pitfalls and more? 

Yes?
