Each week a new play is posted (or delivered to your inbox if you subscribe). Plays are focused articles on **how to become a better freelance web designer or developer**. Think of them like a _super vitamin_ for your freelance career.[->]

Each play will cover topics like:
- Finding better clients
- Increasing your profitability
- Using contracts
- Planning for taxes
- And a whole lot more.
